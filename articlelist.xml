    <abstract>A sensitive and rapid method based on formate-adduct ion detection was developed and fully validated for digoxin determination in rat plasma. For LC/MS/MS detection with formate-adducts as precursor ions, transitions of m/z 825.5→779.9 for digoxin and m/z 809.5→763.4 for the internal standard (digitoxin) were monitored in negative mode. To investigate the impact of formic acid on the mass response and method sensitivity, a formic acid concentration range of 0-0.1% (0, 0.0005%, 0.002%, 0.01%, 0.1%, v/v) was evaluated. A concentration of 0.002% gave the highest sensitivity, which was 16- to 18-fold higher than deprotonated ions, and was designated as the contribution giving the strongest ionization enhancement and adduction. A number of parameters were then varied in order to optimize the method, and a limit of quantitation (LOQ) at 0.2 ng/mL was reached with an injection volume of 5 μL, a total run time of 3 min, and 0.1 mL of rat plasma. A calibration curve was plotted over the range 0.2-50 ng/mL (R(2)=0.9998), and the method was successfully applied to study pharmacokinetics in rat following a single oral administration of digoxin (0.05 mg/kg). Four additional steroid saponins (digitoxin, deslanoside, ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1) were investigated to assess the impact of formic acid on the mass response of steroid saponins. Compounds with a conjugated lactonic ring in their structures such as digoxin, digitoxin and deslanoside tended to form stable formate-adduct ions more easily. The LC/MS/MS method developed here is therefore well suited for the quantification of steroid saponins that are difficult to deprotonate using other MS approaches.</abstract>

    <abstract>OBJECTIVES:The identification of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) biomarkers may serve as a predictor of disease progression and treatment response. The aim of this study was to map potential biomarkers in CTCL plasma. DESIGN AND METHODS:Plasma metabolic perturbations between CTCL cases and healthy individuals were investigated using metabolomics and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS). RESULTS:Principal component analysis (PCA) of the spectra showed clear metabolic changes between the two groups. Thirty six potential biomarkers associated with CTCL were found. CONCLUSIONS:Based on PCA, several biomarkers were determined and further identified by LC/MS/MS analysis. All of these could be potential early markers of CTCL. In addition, we established that heparin as anticoagulant has better pre-treatment results than EDTA with the UHPLC-QTOF/MS approach.</abstract>

    <abstract>An in vivo study of Strychnos alkaloids metabolites in rats by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with linear ion trap Orbitrap MS is reported for the first time. Two major Strychnos alkaloids compounds including strychnine and brucine were investigated. To obtain optimal extraction efficiency, samples were pretreated by using an SPE plate. The structures of metabolites and their fragment ions were characterized based on the accurate mass and MSn data. Forty-seven metabolites were identified in rat urine, of which 25 were reported for the first time. Four new metabolism pathways were proposed on the basis of the identified metabolites. This study provides a practical approach for rapidly identifying complicated metabolites, a methodology that could be widely applied not only in forensic and clinically toxicological relevant cases, but also for the structural characterization of metabolites of other compounds.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this study, the objective was to investigate the degradation behavior of Esomeprazole under different recommended stress conditions according to International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use by HPLC. Our research showed that the effect of mobile phase species on separation was significant for the determination of Esomeprazole and its related compounds. Successful separation of the drug from its related impurities and degradation products formed under different stress conditions was achieved using ammonium acetate buffer/ACN by a gradient elution. Compared with phosphate buffer/ACN, ammonium acetate buffer/ACN under same pH and gradient showed a great improvement in resolution due to the change of elution order. The drug was subjected to stress conditions including acidic, alkaline, oxidative, photolytic, and thermal conditions. Extensive degradation occurred in acidic and oxidative conditions, while mild degradation was observed in alkaline and photolytic conditions. Besides, it turned out the drug was extremely stable under thermal condition. The stability-indicating LC-UV method was validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, and robustness. The LC-MS method was also adopted for the characterization of degradation products. Based on the m/z values and fragmentation patterns, the degradation pathway of the drug has been proposed.</abstract>

    <abstract>A novel capillary zone electrophoresis separation coupled to electro spray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of six toxic alkaloids: brucine, strychnine, atropine sulfate, anisodamine hydrobromide, scopolamine hydrobromide and anisodine hydrobromide in human plasma and urine. To obtain optimal sensitivity, a solid-phase extraction method using Oasis MCX cartridges (1 mL, 30 mg; Waters, USA) for the pretreatment of samples was used. All compounds were separated by capillary zone electrophoresis at 25 kV within 12 min in an uncoated fused-silica capillary of 75 μm id × 100 cm and were detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This method was validated with regard to precision, accuracy, sensitivity, linear range, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). In the plasma and urine samples, the linear calibration curves were obtained over the range of 0.50-100 ng/mL. The LOD and LOQ were 0.2-0.5 ng/mL and 0.5-1.0 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and interday precision was better than 12% and 13%, respectively. Electrophoretic peaks could be identified by mass analysis.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this work, we reported the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrospray ionization multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn) to study the characterization of five triterpenoid saponins from Momordica cochinchinensis extracts in positive ion mode and negative ion mode, revealed the fragmentation behavior of these five M. cochinchinensis saponins in different ion modes. Results showed that in negative ion mode, fragmentation on the M. cochinchinensis triterpenoid saponins at positions C28 and O bond were the primary pathways. In positive ion mode, the predominant diagnostic ions were a series of ions resulting from the rupture of the saccharic chain on C28. Comparison of different fragmentation patterns showed that the results from positive and negative ion ESI MSn were complementary. Both modes can yield structurally different information for the characterization of triterpenoid saponins. This study provides a powerful method for the online structural identification of five triterpenoid saponins from M. cochinchinensis, and some of which have not been reported.</abstract>

    <abstract>A reliable and validated LC–MS method was established for a hexokinase inhibitor study based on adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) determination. By adding 5 mM ammonium acetate in the aqueous phase, this method enabled the determination of ATP by LC–MS and greatly increased the MS signal of ATP. This method was used in the study of the anticancer mechanism of Momordica cochinchinensis, an exact ingredient which had exhibited certain hexokinase inhibitor activity. This might reveal the anticancer mechanism of Momordica cochinchinensis.</abstract>

    <abstract>For the first time a sensitive, specific and rapid LC–MS–MS assay is presented for the simultaneous determination of levodopa (L-DP), 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) and benserazide (BSZ) in human serum. The three compounds were extracted from human serum by protein precipitation followed by dilution of the supernatant with aqueous formic acid. In serum, linearity was observed between 50 and 1,000 ng mL−1 of L-DP, 3-OMD and BSZ, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day RSD values were below 10.56 and 6.22% at concentrations of 120, 360 and 720 ng mL−1. The presented method showed excellent specificity and sensitivity compared with other methods reported. It was applied to a pharmacokinetic study and demonstrated its applicability to pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological research.</abstract>

    <abstract>A sensitive and effort-saving method was established and validated for the quantitative determination of recombinant Arg-Gly-Asp-hirudin (rRGD-hirudin) in human urine samples. The assay was performed on a uncoated fused silica capillary of 70 cm x 50 microm I.D. and a positive voltage of 30 kV was applied. The sample was injected under pressure of 50 mbar for 300 s and the temperature of capillary was kept 25 degrees C. Sheath liquid consisting of 30% methanol and 70% of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution flowing at 7 microL/min was supplied to the CE-electrospray interface. Utilizing the dynamic pH junction technique, a lower limit of quantitation of approximately 35 nM was achieved (concentration coefficiency was about 100-fold) without complex sample preprocessing procedure. CE-MS conditions and parameters were also optimized to obtain better performance. The method has been successfully applied in clinical research of rRGD-hirudin.</abstract>
